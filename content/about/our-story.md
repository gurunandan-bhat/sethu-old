Founded in 2005 by Dr Nandita de Souza, a developmental paediatrician, and five other champions
for inclusion, Sethu was born of the conviction that all children, particularly the most vulnerable,
must receive a fair chance to realise their potential.

Our first professional team comprised Dr Nandita, Yogita Joshi, special educator, and Anjali
Barretto, speech and language therapist. Our three founder trustees were Elvina Menezes, Ameeta
Mascarenhas and Sneha Bhandare. The first time we opened doors, it was in a compact two-
bedroom apartment generously offered by Eric Menezes.

The demand for our services escalated rapidly, with an ever-increasing number of referrals,
community outreach programmes, group interventions, and requests for training and internships. By
the age of 18, we’d expanded our team ten times over and moved four times. Our last move was
into a lovely property bequeathed by our dear friend and supporter, Alessandro Bafico.

In 2022, we completed the ground-breaking of our new building designed with fit-for-purpose
facilities for assessments, a variety of therapies, counselling, safe play, teaching, training and much
more.  It will enable us to reach countless more children and those who care for them. Our
permanent centre in Guirim, will serve as an example of what a neurodiversity-affirming space has
to offer.
