AATISH (Autism Advocacy, Training, Intervention, Support and Hope), our autism programme, develops interventions in social-communication and social skills, behaviour management, toilet training, sleep, sensory integration, motor development and more. We use a parent-coaching approach to ensure families are empowered to support their children.

Individual, corporate and institutional donors who share our vision of inclusion enable us to charge nominal fees on a sliding scale based on a familyâ€™s ability to pay.
