The training phase of the project was followed by on-site visits to each of the balwadis. We traversed the length and breadth of Goa to observe our trained teachers apply their new knowledge and continue to refine this model. The helpers played a proactive teaching role in their balwadis which was refreshing to observe. The project training and following onsite visits highlighted the need for training and ongoing support for the helpers and teachers who need to play multiple roles within their balwadis. They are willing and able to understand and use what they learned. However the work overload proves a deterrent to proper teaching. A majority of helpers and teachers took the initiative to print visual aids for teaching, use grouping and implement buddy systems to encourage learning and better classroom management. However there were some teachers that stuck to traditional methods of teaching that encourage passive listening and memorization. This highlighted the essential need for ongoing training, mentorship and monitoring of the balwadi staff. We have decided to train the Mukhiya Sevikas or supervisors who conduct ongoing training and site visits to the balwadis under their care. These Mukhiya Sevikas themselves would need the support and guidance of trained personnel which leads to the need for a cadre of chld development workers as additional project staff that would be trained for this purpose.
