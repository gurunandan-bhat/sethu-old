Sethu's mission is to be a bridge between children and their communities at large. Schools and teachers form an important part of this caring circle. Gnyandeep, our preschool teachersâ€™ training program, aims to create environments that foster the development of ALL children. The fact that children with special needs are often identified first in their balwadis and preschools guided our decision to focus on training teachers who work at the grass root levels i.e. balwadis. Starting in 2015, we have trained the balwadi teachers and helpers from 26 anganwadis across all 12 talukas in Goa, giving them a thorough understanding of child development and behavior, multiple intelligences and common disabilities. It was heartening to hear that the teachers and the helpers found the training very practical and relevant. The teachers could add many ideas to their repertoire of teaching activities, to make them more child friendly and multisensory. The helpers particularly appreciated the information on how to handle children's tantrums and misbehavior without beating them. Many said that they have never been trained before and were initially reluctant to attend. However once they started the training they found it extremely useful and learned a lot. One helper said that for the first time she felt a sense of self-worth.
