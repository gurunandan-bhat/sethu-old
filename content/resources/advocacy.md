We advocate for the effective implementation of neurodiversity-affirming policies by fostering close
relationships with schools, community groups and government agencies.

In addition to collaborating with government agencies and families to acquire entitlements such as
UDID cards, disability certificates and social security benefits, we advocate for inclusion through
radio, television, the press and digital media.

Commemorative days such as World Disability Day, World Autism Day, Autistic Pride Day, Down
Syndrome Day, World Mental Health Day and ADHD month are rich with opportunities to raise
awareness. We’ve also been active participants at Purple Fest, India’s first-of-its-kind international
festival of inclusion.
