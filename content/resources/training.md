Inculcating a culture of learning and evidence-based action by proactively engaging, collaborating with and building capacities through webinars, collaborative workshops and other training programmes, is a very important aspect of our work.

#### Academic Interest

At our monthly sessions, our staff benefit from the expertise and experience of internal and external speakers.

#### Gnyandeep

A teacher training programme to strengthen the capacities of anganwadi workers (AWWs) to identify children with neurodevelopmental delays, intervene early and create neurodiversity-affirming classrooms.

#### Agle Kadam

A programme conducted by our family advisors to orient parents of children whose children are newly diagnosed at Sethu on the path ahead.

#### Webinars and Workshops

Our training for families, teachers, students and other professionals is delivered through webinars and in-person collaborative workshops on a range of subjects, such as sexuality education, ADHD, behaviour and inclusion in school. They’re particularly powerful in that they share the lived experiences of parents who’ve experienced success in these areas
