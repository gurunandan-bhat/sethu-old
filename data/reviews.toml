quote = "Aditya was 11 when we met Dr Nandita by chance and explained why he had the habit of holding his breath underwater for extended periods. Not one doctor since he was 5 had been able to explain it. We went home and tried what she suggested and he was such a happy cookie. Next day we were at Sethu and have been like betaal behind Vikram ever since."

quote = "I'd forgotten myself so completely that I didn't realise that if I don't have peace of mind, I can't help my child. That's when I started sessions for myself as a mother. I came back to Sethu and booked a session with the therapist for myself. After some sessions I realised that to be there for my son 100%, I need to have my 100% first. I still sometimes struggle with this but with time I'm improving."

quote = "Ojas was diagnosed with autism as an infant but we didn't want to accept the diagnosis at the time. Many doctors and elders told us he'd start speaking any day. But eventually we realised it wasn't going to happen. He used to be very hyper. He's calmed down a lot because of the therapy. He's very excited about coming here."
